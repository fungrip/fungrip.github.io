<h2 id="virtualgoodsandvirtualmoney">Virtual Goods and Virtual Money</h2>
<p>Our Games may include virtual currencies (“Virtual Money”) or items or services for use with our Games (“Virtual Goods”). If you are over 18 years old you may be able to buy Virtual Goods or Virtual Money. You agree that once purchased Virtual Money and Virtual Goods have no monetary value and can never be exchanged for real money, real goods or real services from us or anyone else.

The balance of virtual goods or virtual currency does not contain real value. The user agrees that the sales of all virtual currencies and goods are final and that the company does not make refunds once the transactions are complete. When a user purchases virtual goods or currencies from the company, the delivery of goods will be carried out as soon as the purchase is complete and thus, the user agrees that they forfeit the right to withdraw and cancel since they have already received the benefits of the relevant virtual goods and/or currencies. The company may manage, regulate, change or remove the contents of all virtual currencies or goods without being held liable by the user. When the company stops or terminates the user’s account without limits to its contents according to the Terms and Conditions of the company, the user will lose all of the virtual currencies and goods they hold and the company will not make a refund and compensate for the loss. You agree that Fungrip is not required to provide a refund for Virtual Items for any reason, and that you will not receive money or other compensation for unused Virtual Items, whether your loss of license under these Agreement was voluntary or involuntary.</p>
